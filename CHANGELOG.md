## 2026-02-22

**Outcome:** Completed full PKM migration from Obsidian to PKM5 SQLite across all 7 phases: 27 dimensions created, ~210 vault nodes migrated with 250 wiki-link edges, 20 slash commands rewritten for PKM5 MCP tools, Atlas memory guide ported, LLM routing (confidential → Maci Ollama) inlined into 3 skills, Paperless full pipeline built (35 nodes enriched with OCR), heartbeat rewritten as direct SQLite queries with launchd deployment, iOS/macOS shortcuts updated for PKM5 endpoints.
**Decision:** Heartbeat moved from Maci cron to MacBook launchd (PKM5 SQLite is local). Dashboard decommissioned (all workflows covered by PKM5 skills). Atlas-framework retired.
**Files:** scripts/paperless/ingest.py, scripts/heartbeat.py, scripts/install-heartbeat.sh, .claude/commands/*.md (20 files), .claude/guides/memory.md, docs/shortcuts/README.md, CLAUDE.md, scripts/migrate/import_pkm2026.ts
